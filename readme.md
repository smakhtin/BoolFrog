#Bool Frog

Bool Frog is a set of animation and logic nodes for Grasshopper, inspired by VVVV. Most nodes have the same functionality and pin names, as VVVV's originals. The project is fully opensource, you can get compiled gha files from Downloads section.

##Installation

Download (latest version)[https://github.com/downloads/smakhtin/BoolFrog/BoolFrog.zip] and unpack it to the Components folder inside Grasshopper installation dirrectory.

## How you can help

* All nodes currently don't have any icons. You can draw some and send it to me for integration.
* Because i just solving my friends requests, set of nodes currently is very limited. If you whant some new animation nodes, just suggest it to me or implement by yourself and do pullrequest.
* I think current pin naming is not best, if you have any suggestions feel free to contact with me.
* I not an expert in Grasshopper's graph paradigm, so if you know how to improve behaviours of TogEdge, Delay or Change for example, do it.
